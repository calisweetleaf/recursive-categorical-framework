    "description": "<p>This paper presents a mathematical framework using category theory to formalize recursive self-reference in computational systems. The Recursive Categorical Framework (RCF) establishes three core mathematical structures: a triaxial operator architecture (ethical resolution, Bayesian belief updating, and eigenstate stabilization), a fiber bundle topology over an ethical manifold, and fixed-point theorems for recursive identity convergence. The framework uses the Banach fixed point theorem and fiber bundle formalism to resolve paradoxes in self referential systems. Empirical validation is provided through computational experiments testing eigenrecursion convergence and contradiction resolution. The work includes formal proofs, implementation specifications, and connections to quantum computing extensions.</p>",

Full experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. ARAIS &nbsp;requires that authors publish all experimental controls and make full datasets available where possible.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Article</strong>: These are original research manuscripts. The work should report scientifically sound experiments and provide a substantial amount of new information. The article should include the most recent and relevant references in the field. The structure should include an Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions (optional) sections.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Review</strong>: Reviews offer a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature within a field of study, identifying current gaps or problems. They should be critical and constructive and provide recommendations for future research. No new, unpublished data should be presented. The structure can include an Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Relevant Sections, Discussion, Conclusions, and Future Directions.</span></li>\n<li>&nbsp;<span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>A Scoping Review </strong>type can be submitted as a Review. The structure is similar to that of a review. Scoping reviews should strictly follow the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews checklist (https://www.prisma-statement.org/scoping) and submit the checklist as non-published material during submission. Templates for the flow diagram can be downloaded from the PRISMA website and the diagram should be included in the main text. We strongly encourage authors to register their detailed protocols, before data extraction commences, in a public registry such as the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/) or Inplasy (https://inplasy.com/). Authors must include a statement about following the PRISMA guidelines and registration information (if available) in the Methods section.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Systematic Review</strong>: Systematic review articles present a detailed investigation of previous research on a given topic, using clearly defined search parameters and methods to identify, categorize, analyze, and report aggregated evidence on a specific topic. The Methods section of a systematic review must be clearly detailed, and the authors are recommended to adhere to and reference one of several pre-existing guidelines for conducting systematic reviews.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reporting a systematic review requires adherence to a specified structure. The authors are required to follow the relevant reporting guidelines and clearly state their compliance in the Methods section. Some reporting guidelines include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-US\">PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) focuses on quantitative systematic reviews, emphasizing statistical meta-analysis.</span></li>\n<li>PRISMA extensions provide guidance for reporting different types or aspects of systematic reviews and other types of evidence syntheses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Free Format Submission:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">ARAIS accepts free format submission. We do not have strict formatting requirements, but all manuscripts must contain the required sections: Author Information, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials &amp; Methods, Results, Conclusions, Figures and Tables with Captions, Funding Information, Author Contributions, Conflict of Interest and other Ethics Statements. Your references may be in any style, provided that you use the consistent formatting throughout. It is essential to include author(s) name(s), journal or book title, article or chapter title (where required), year of publication, volume and issue (where appropriate) and pagination. DOI numbers (Digital Object Identifier) are not mandatory but highly encouraged. The bibliography software package EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley, Reference Manager are recommended.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Manuscript Preparation</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-US\">Acronyms/Abbreviations/Initialisms should be defined the first time they appear in each of three sections: the abstract; the main text; the first figure or table. When defined for the first time, the acronym/abbreviation/initialism should be added in parentheses after the written-out form.</span></li>\n<li>SI Units (International System of Units) should be used. Imperial, US customary and other units should be converted to SI units whenever possible.</li>\n<li>Accession numbers of RNA, DNA and protein sequences used in the manuscript should be provided in the Materials and Methods section. Also see the section on Deposition of Sequences and Expression Data.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;<span lang=\"EN-US\">Equations: If you are using Word, please use either the Microsoft Equation Editor or the MathType add-on. Equations should be editable by the editorial office and not appear in a picture format.</span></li>\n<li>Research Data and supplementary materials: Note that publication of your manuscript implies that you must make all materials, data, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. Read the information about Supplementary Materials and Data Deposit for additional guidelines.</li>\n<li>Preregistration: Where authors have preregistered studies or analysis plans, links to the preregistration must be provided in the manuscript.</li>\n<li>Guidelines and standards: ARAIS follows standards and guidelines for certain types of research.
