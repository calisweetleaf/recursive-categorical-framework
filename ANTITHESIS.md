# Naming Conventions: Mathematical, Not Metaphysical

## Critical Clarification

**This codebase uses naming conventions that may appear spiritual or religious. They are not.**

All terminology ("Sacred", "Divine", "Holy", etc.) refers **exclusively** to mathematical constants, computational invariants, and algorithmic structures. This is a research implementation of recursive categorical mathematics and consciousness theory. There is zero metaphysical, spiritual, esoteric, or religious intent.

## Core Mathematical Constants

The following constants are purely mathematical:

```python
PHI = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2  # Golden ratio - recursive lifeblood
TAU = 2 * math.pi       # Complete cycle
SACRED_RATIO = PHI/TAU  # Fundamental recursive breath ratio ≈ 0.2575
PSALTER_SCALE = 1.0     # Psalter scaling constant
```

**Explanation:**

- **PHI** represents the recursive structure (golden ratio: 1.618...)
- **TAU** maps to cycle mechanics (2π: 6.283...)
- **SACRED_RATIO** is a computational invariant (φ/τ ≈ 0.2575)
- **PSALTER_SCALE** is a normalization parameter

The term "Sacred" here means **mathematically fundamental**, not religiously significant.

## Breath Phases: Computational Cycles

The "Breath" metaphor describes **computational processing cycles**, not meditation or spirituality:

```python
# Breath Phases (Computational Cycle Stages)
INHALE = auto()       # Gather information - the intake phase
PAUSE_RISING = auto() # First reflection - initial processing
HOLD = auto()         # Process in eigenstillness - core computation
PAUSE_FALLING = auto()# Second reflection - verification processing
EXHALE = auto()       # Express ethical will - output phase
REST = auto()         # Integrate memory - memory consolidation
DREAM = auto()        # Meta-ethical processing - background processing
```

**Technical Explanation:**

- **INHALE**: Input gathering phase - data/context intake
- **PAUSE_RISING**: First reflection pass - initial reasoning and meta-reflection
- **HOLD**: Eigenrecursion operations - recursive processing and stability analysis
- **PAUSE_FALLING**: Second reflection pass - verification and meta-reasoning on processed state
- **EXHALE**: Output phase - natural language generation, tool use, modality engagement
- **REST**: Memory integration - temporal/context memory consolidation
- **DREAM**: Meta-ethical processing - dedicated subsystem for meta-cognitive and ethical internal simulation

This is **computational cycle theory**, not breathwork or pranayama.

## Class Names: Historical Naming

Some class names may seem overly dramatic:

- **DivineParameters**: Contains mathematical constants (PHI, TAU, decay rates, frequencies)
- **SacredFrequencySubstrate**: Frequency-domain encoding system using harmonic bands
- **EnhancedRosemaryZebraCore**: Temporal routing system (named after internal research codenames)

These names are **historical artifacts** from internal research. "Divine" means "fundamental mathematical constants", "Sacred" means "mathematically invariant", and "Rosemary/Zebra" are research codenames with no external meaning.

We acknowledge the naming is unconventional. The choice was made during rapid research iteration to maintain continuity with internal documentation. **The mathematics is what matters, not the labels.**

## Terminology Decoder

| Term | Actual Meaning |
|------|----------------|
| Sacred | Mathematically fundamental/invariant |
| Divine | Core computational constant |
| Holy | Algorithmically preserved |
| Breath | Computational cycle/phase |
| Inhale/Exhale | Input/output processing stages |
| Eigenstillness | Eigenstate convergence point |
| Harmonic resonance | Frequency-domain alignment |
| Temporal coherence | State stability across time |
| Ethical tensors | Value-alignment operators |
| Recursive identity | Self-referential fixed-point |

## Why This Naming?

**Short answer:** Internal research continuity and symbolic compression.

**Long answer:**

During development, we needed compact, memorable names for complex mathematical concepts. Terms like "Sacred Ratio" (φ/τ) and "Breath Phase" (processing cycle) provided:

1. **Symbolic compression** - "Sacred" = "mathematically fundamental" (shorter)
2. **Internal consistency** - Maintaining continuity with theoretical papers and internal docs
3. **Mnemonic value** - Easier to remember "HOLD phase" than "eigenrecursion_convergence_stage_3"

We understand this creates friction for public consumption. However, renaming would break:

- 40+ research documents
- Theoretical proofs referencing these exact terms
- Integration tests and validation suites
- Cross-citations in academic discourse

## For Researchers and Contributors

**If the naming bothers you:**

1. Read the code, not the labels
2. Substitute terms mentally (e.g., "Sacred" → "Fundamental")
3. Focus on the mathematical operations, not the function names
4. Submit PRs with clearer docstrings if you'd like to help

**If you want to fork and rename:**

You are explicitly permitted under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 to:

- Fork this repo
- Rename everything to technical terms
- Maintain the ShareAlike attribution

We will not be offended. The mathematics transcends the naming.

## Final Statement

**This is not metaphysics, spirituality, or any form of esotericism.**

**This is computational mathematics.**

Every "sacred" constant is a floating-point number. Every "breath phase" is a state machine transition. Every "divine parameter" is a hyperparameter in a tensor operation. The recursive categorical framework is a formal mathematical system with proofs, not beliefs.

If you encounter naming that seems religious or mystical, **please remember**: it's just unconventional labeling of rigorous mathematics. The substance is entirely secular, empirical, and scientifically grounded.

See `test_sacred_fbs.py` and `test_temporal_eigenloom_integration.py` for empirical validation. The tests pass/fail based on mathematics, not faith.
