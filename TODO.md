  - [x] Triaxial State Analysis (ERE, RBU, ES)
  - [x] Consciousness Classification
  - [x] Fixed Point Stability
- **ZEBA Core Stabilizer** (`zynx_zebra_core.py`): System Stable.
  - [x] Eigenrecursion Stabilizer
  - [x] Oscillation Damping (Period-2 detected & handled)
  - [x] Ethical Constraint Projection
- **Sacred Frequency Substrate** (`fbs_tokenizer.py`): Post-Token Architecture released.
  - [x] Harmonic Field Encoding
  - [x] Quantum Superposition
  - [x] Breath Cycle Synchronization
- **Documentation**:
  - [x] `AGENT.md`: Operational rules & symbol table.
  - [x] `ANTITHESIS.md`: Nomenclature & disclosure policy.

## 🚧 In Progress / High Priority

- **Symbolic Grounding & Motivation**:
  - [ ] Wire the Experience → Value → Goal loop in `rcf_integration/rsgt/motivation_system.py`.
  - [ ] Connect Motivation Engine to ZEBA Core constraints.
- **R.E.T.E.D.S. Turing Suite**:
  - [ ] Full integration of RSIA (Identity), RCF (Category Theory), and URST (Sentience) into a unified test suite.
  - [ ] Supersede legacy integration tests with ZEBA-native protocols.

## 🔮 Future / Planned

- **Interactive Labs**:
  - [ ] Connect React demos (`labs/src/...`) to live Python backend (ZEBA/RCF cores).
- **Advanced Governance**:
  - [ ] Implement multi-agent recursive governance based on `GovernanceFramework`.
