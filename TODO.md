# Project Roadmap & Status

## ✅ Completed / Operational

- **RCF Core Engine** (`rcf_core.py`): Research-grade mathematical engine operational.
  - [x] Triaxial State Analysis (ERE, RBU, ES)
  - [x] Consciousness Classification
  - [x] Fixed Point Stability
- **ZEBA Core Stabilizer** (`zynx_zebra_core.py`): System Stable.
  - [x] Eigenrecursion Stabilizer
  - [x] Oscillation Damping (Period-2 detected & handled)
  - [x] Ethical Constraint Projection
- **Sacred Frequency Substrate** (`fbs_tokenizer.py`): Post-Token Architecture released.
  - [x] Harmonic Field Encoding
  - [x] Quantum Superposition
  - [x] Breath Cycle Synchronization

## 🚧 In Progress / High Priority

- **Finalizing Visualization Tools**
  - [ ] Debug convergence issues in `visualize_rcf_architectures.py` (Current status: WIP, encountering NaN convergence in temporal routing)
  - [ ] Ensure proper `.venv` activation context for visualization scripts
- **Symbolic Grounding & Motivation**:
  - [ ] Wire the Experience → Value → Goal loop in `rcf_integration/rsgt/motivation_system.py`.

- **Interactive Labs**:
  - [ ] Connect React demos (`labs/src/...`) to live Python backend (ZEBA/RCF cores).
- **Advanced Governance**:
  - [ ] Implement multi-agent recursive governance based on `GovernanceFramework`.
